# Setup

To use [discord-buttons](https://npmjs.com/discord-buttons), you must put this in your main file (usually index.js) after your discord.js [Client](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client)

```js
require("discord-buttons")(client);
```

You can also do this:

```js
const disbut = require("discord-buttons");
disbut(client);
```

Then, you can use [disbut.MessageButton](../constructors/message-button) and [disbut.MessageActionRow](../constructors/message-action-row) in your main file.

### But I use a command handler!

Look no further! Here is how you can do it:

```js
import require('discord-buttons')(client); //in your main file after your client, and on the command file put:
const { MessageButton, MessageActionRow } = require('discord-buttons');
```

or:

```js
const disbut = require("discord-buttons");
```

Then you can do:

```js
let btn = new MessageButton();
//or
let btn = new disbut.MessageButton();
```
