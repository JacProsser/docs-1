# Installation

Before installing the npm package, we must first make sure that we have discord.js v12 +. To do this we can open a command prompt where your node_modules are installed and type:

```sh
$ npm list discord.js
```

The output should look something like this:

```sh
`-- discord.js@12.5.3
```

Once you have confirmed that you have a compatible version you can now move onto the next step. To install the npm package, open the command prompt and type:

```sh
$ npm install discord-buttons
```
